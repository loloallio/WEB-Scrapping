HI! I'm Lorenzo

This is my first python project. 

It is a webscrapping python script which downloads the link, tittle, description and date from DLA Piper's press releases.

The programm is divided into 2 scripts "Main File" and "Parsing source2"

Main File: 
   It uses the Selenium module to get a text file, where the webpage's source is written.

Parsing Source2:
   With the openpyxl library and regex, this scrip searches for the information and the it writes the information in an excel.

The .exe was created using auto-py-to-exe. It is detected as a virus, but I'm working on it. Feel free to investigate the code to be secure that it is not a virus.

Thanks,
Lorenzo
